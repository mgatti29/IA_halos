# IA_halos Repository

Welcome to the IA_halos repository! This repository aims to provide an introduction to key concepts in weak lensing, cosmic shear, and intrinsic alignment.

Overview
Weak lensing is a powerful observational technique that allows us to probe the gravitational distortion of light as it travels across the universe. By studying the subtle bending of light due to the gravitational pull of matter, we can gain insights into the distribution of dark matter, the properties of galaxy clusters, and the large-scale structure of the cosmos.

Cosmic shear, a specific manifestation of weak lensing, refers to the statistical measurement of the coherent distortion of galaxy shapes on cosmological scales. It provides valuable information about the distribution of matter and the growth of structure in the universe. Through careful analysis of cosmic shear data, we can constrain cosmological parameters, investigate the nature of dark matter, and shed light on the mysterious dark energy.

Intrinsic alignment, on the other hand, explores the alignment of galaxy shapes and orientations caused by physical processes within galaxies themselves. This phenomenon plays a crucial role in weak lensing analyses, as it introduces systematic effects that must be understood and accounted for to ensure accurate measurements.

Repository Content
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to provide a short introduction to weak lensing, cosmic shear, and intrinsic alignment. Each notebook is accompanied by explanations, code examples, and visualizations to facilitate understanding and provide hands-on experience with the concepts discussed.

Getting Started
To get started, simply clone this repository to your local machine and explore the notebooks. You will find detailed instructions within each notebook, guiding you through the concepts and analyses step by step. Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different parameters, and expand upon the provided examples to deepen your understanding.
